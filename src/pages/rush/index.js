} > <p > Welcome to the Chi Sigma Chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi.As you spend time getting to know our chapter, I encourage you to be curious, ask lots of questions, and truly learn about our brotherhood throughout Rush Week. < /p> <
    p >
    Our organization is the oldest and largest professional business fraternity in the country.As such, Alpha Kappa Psi is one of
    the most valuable organizations that bridge the gap between higher education and the workforce. <
    /p > <p > I joined Alpha Kappa Psi in the spring semester of my freshman year in the midst of the COVID - 19 pandemic.At the time, the majority of my college experience thus far consisted of me sitting alone in my dorm room— in other words, I had little - to - no community or opportunities for any type of growth. {
  " "
} < /p> <
    p >
    That semester was transformative.The rush process alone taught me so much, but when it concluded, I knew I wanted to learn more.The rest of the semester taught me to embrace a growth mindset, and throughout my past two years in the fraternity, I found new ways to challenge myself and
    continue that growth. {
            " "
        } <
        /p > <p > Upon joining Alpha Kappa Psi, I found myself a part of a community that reaches far beyond the college experience and into the rest of your life.We are proud to say that our network is one of the most extensive among all organizations across the world.Our chapters span all across the United States and even internationally in cities such as London and Hong Kong.Brothers are constantly connecting with one another, regardless of location, age, or career path.Our community allows for constant mentorship and support wherever you are. < /p>

    <
    p >
    After gaining so much from Alpha Kappa Psi— professional development, personal growth, an everlasting community— I knew I wanted to give back, leading me to run
    for president of our chapter. <
    /p > <p > While there are many organizations that can help you realize your professional potential, Alpha Kappa Psi is an organization that builds character.Brothers at Alpha Kappa Psi have qualities affirming our five core values : brotherhood, knowledge, integrity, service, and unity.Most importantly, we encourage each other to build leadership skills and relationships beyond the professional–– to provide an unwavering support system and help each other grow. < /p> <
    p >
    The Rush process is all about exploration and discovery.Regardless of the outcome at the end of the process, I hope you are able to leave with new interests, skills, relationships, and confidence.On behalf of Chi Sigma, we welcome you to cultivate your aspirations and inspirations, with Alpha Kappa Psi. <
